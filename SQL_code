--Project Description: The Patient Health Monitoring and Analysis project aims to develop a comprehensive system for analyzing and monitoring patient health using SQL and a healthcare dataset. The project utilizes advanced SQL concepts, such as data manipulation, aggregation, and joining, to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and derive valuable healthcare-related information. The project focuses on areas like chronic disease management, medication adherence, patient demographics, and healthcare outcomes. By leveraging a suitable healthcare dataset, the project enables in-depth analysis of patient health records, segmentation of patients based on various factors, identification of trends and patterns, and deriving actionable insights for improved healthcare decision-making.

--Key Features:
  --SQL-based Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze patient health data.
  --Comprehensive Health Monitoring: Analyze patient health records, chronic disease management, medication adherence, demographics, and         healthcare outcomes.
  --Data-driven Insights: Derive meaningful insights and patterns to improve healthcare decision-making.
  --Patient Segmentation: Segment patients based on various factors like demographics, disease type, medication adherence, and healthcare       utilization.
  --Trend Analysis: Identify trends, patterns, and correlations in patient health data over time.
  --Project Flexibility: Choose a specific area of focus, such as chronic disease management or medication adherence, based on the  
    available healthcare dataset.
  --Enhanced Healthcare Decision-making: Utilize the insights gained from the analysis to optimize healthcare services, improve patient 
    outcomes, and support evidence-based decision-making.

--SQL Code:

1. Identify any significant differences in disease progression based on demographic factors such as age, gender, or ethnicity, while considering the patients' insurance coverage?

SELECT demographic_factor, insurance_coverage, AVG(disease_progression) AS avg_disease_progression
FROM patient_health_records
GROUP BY demographic_factor, insurance_coverage;

2. What is the relationship between a patient's socioeconomic status and their access to healthcare services, and how does it impact their health outcomes, considering the patient's proximity to healthcare facilities?

SELECT socioeconomic_status, AVG(health_outcomes) AS avg_health_outcomes
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN patient_addresses ON patient_health_records.patient_id = patient_addresses.patient_id
GROUP BY socioeconomic_status;

3. Identify any patterns or predictors for hospital readmissions among patients with specific chronic diseases, considering the length of hospital stay for each admission?

SELECT chronic_disease, AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS avg_length_of_stay, predictor_variable, COUNT(*) AS readmission_count
FROM patient_health_records
WHERE hospital_readmission = 1
GROUP BY chronic_disease, predictor_variable
ORDER BY readmission_count DESC;

4. How does the utilization of healthcare resources vary across different regions or healthcare facilities, considering the patients' primary care providers?

SELECT region, healthcare_facility, AVG(resource_utilization) AS avg_resource_utilization
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN primary_care_providers ON patient_health_records.patient_id = primary_care_providers.patient_id
GROUP BY region, healthcare_facility;

5. Identify any correlations between medication adherence and disease management outcomes, considering the patients' appointment attendance?

SELECT medication_adherence, AVG(disease_management_outcomes) AS avg_disease_management_outcomes
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN appointments ON patient_health_records.patient_id = appointments.patient_id
GROUP BY medication_adherence;

6. What are the common risk factors associated with the development of specific chronic diseases, considering the patients' family medical history?

SELECT chronic_disease, risk_factor, COUNT(*) AS risk_factor_count
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN family_medical_history ON patient_health_records.patient_id = family_medical_history.patient_id
GROUP BY chronic_disease, risk_factor
ORDER BY risk_factor_count DESC;
7. How does the prevalence of chronic diseases differ among different racial or ethnic groups, considering the patients' geographic locations?

SELECT racial_ethnic_group, chronic_disease, COUNT(*) AS disease_count
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN patient_addresses ON patient_health_records.patient_id = patient_addresses.patient_id
GROUP BY racial_ethnic_group, chronic_disease
ORDER BY disease_count DESC;

8. Identify any trends or patterns in the occurrence of adverse drug reactions among patients, considering the patients' medication history?

SELECT drug_name, occurrence_year, COUNT(*) AS adverse_reaction_count
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN medications ON patient_health_records.patient_id = medications.patient_id
WHERE adverse_reaction = 1
GROUP BY drug_name, occurrence_year;

9. What are the factors that influence patient satisfaction with their healthcare experience, and how does it impact their treatment outcomes, considering the healthcare providers' ratings?

SELECT satisfaction_factor, AVG(treatment_outcomes) AS avg_treatment_outcomes
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN healthcare_providers ON patient_health_records.provider_id = healthcare_providers.provider_id
GROUP BY satisfaction_factor;

10. How does the availability and accessibility of healthcare facilities impact patient health outcomes, taking into account geographic locations and patient demographics?

SELECT region, facility_type, AVG(health_outcomes) AS avg_health_outcomes
FROM patient_health_records
JOIN healthcare_facilities ON patient_health_records.facility_id = healthcare_facilities.facility_id
JOIN patient_addresses ON patient_health_records.patient_id = patient_addresses.patient_id
GROUP BY region, facility_type;
